         </h1>
         <p>Traditional shows have a tight framework — the time of the
             show is limited, the plot is predetermined, actors play on stage,
             the audience watches in the hall.</p>
         <p>The immersive show lasts all day and takes place «in the
             crowd» — the audience becomes participants and their
             reaction changes the plot — actors constantly improvise
             immersing the audience even deeper and deeper.
         </p>
         <p style="margin-bottom: 0">The good show takes a person out of reality into a fantasy
             world by offering a vivid plot, thoughtful scenery and
             psychological tricks, swinging emotions from constrained
             modesty and cautious curiosity to euphoria and the triumph of
             their own dashing!</p>

                 <h2>My name is Oleksandr Kulynych,
                     I am 36 years old and I am the
                     producer of this project</h2>
                 <p>For the last 14 years I have owned a
                     successful IT business. 6 years ago I sold my
                     stake in the company, got away from
                     operational management and for the last 5
                     years I’ve fallen for TV — I supervised the
                     launch of a satellite TV-channel in Germany
                     and preparation of a number of TV-shows.
                     This project is a reflection of my childhood
                     dream: I wanted to become a director of a
                     traveling circus</p>
