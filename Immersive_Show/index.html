                As hotel guests continue to seek out
                unique experiences during their travels,
                it’s becoming more and more difficult
                for the hoteliers to attract them.
            </p>
            <p> I would like to offer immersive entertainment
                as an emerging field that could help hoteliers

                immersive show?
            </h1>
            <p>Traditional shows have a tight framework — the time of the
                show is limited, the plot is predetermined, actors play on stage,
                the audience watches in the hall.</p>
            <p>The immersive show lasts all day and takes place «in the
                crowd» — the audience becomes participants and their
                reaction changes the plot — actors constantly improvise
                immersing the audience even deeper and deeper.
            </p>
            <p style="margin-bottom: 0">The good show takes a person out of reality into a fantasy
                world by offering a vivid plot, thoughtful scenery and
                psychological tricks, swinging emotions from constrained
                modesty and cautious curiosity to euphoria and the triumph of
                their own dashing!</p>

                            happening nearby the hotel — strange
                            sounds, a flash, people running around with

                            making some strange manipulations with
